## :hearts:Console blackjack
This project is a console realization of the casino game "blackjack" on Python.
</br>
There are no usages of OOP paradigms so the work is quite simple. You can check the rules <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack">here</a>.
</br>
The feature of current realization is if the dealer reaches 17 points, the system shows his cards. It distinguishes in some way from classic rules.
Have pleasure!
