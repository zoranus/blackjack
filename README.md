This project is a console realization of casino game "blackjack" on Python. 
There are no usages of OOP paradigms so the work is quite simple.
You can check rules here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Rule_variations_and_effects_on_house_edge.

NOTE: the feature of current realization is if dealer reaches 17 points, system shows his cards. It distinquishes in some way from classic rules.

Have pleasure!
