## :hearts:Console blackjack
This project is a console realization of casino game "blackjack" on Python. 
</br>
There are no usages of OOP paradigms so the work is quite simple.
You can check rules <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Rule_variations_and_effects_on_house_edge">here</a>.

NOTE: the feature of current realization is if dealer reaches 17 points, system shows his cards. It distinquishes in some way from classic rules.

Have pleasure!
